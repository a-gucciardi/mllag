The frontal lobe is one of the four major lobes of the cerebral cortex, responsible for higher cognitive functions such as decision-making, problem-solving, and language processing. The presence of a glioma tumor in this area may affect these cognitive functions depending on its size and progression. Further evaluation by a medical professional would be necessary to determine the grade and stage of the tumor, as well as to discuss treatment options and prognosis.",
